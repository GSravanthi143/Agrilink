## 🚜 Problem Overview

Agriculture is seasonal and highly time-sensitive. During planting and harvesting periods, farmers struggle to find enough laborers due to:

- Dependence on word-of-mouth hiring  
- Lack of centralized labor information  
- Seasonal unavailability of workers  
- Wage inconsistencies  
- Manual and time-consuming search process  

These issues often result in delayed harvesting, crop loss, reduced productivity, and financial instability for farmers.
